//! The `sample` module provides the `Sample` trait and its implementations.
//!
//! The purpose of this module is similar to that of `num::traits` in the `num`
//! crate, but the `Sample` type has been specialised more towards FLAC in
//! particular. For instance, it is only implemented for types that can be
//! encountered in a FLAC stream. (This excludes `i64` and unsigned integers.)

/// A trait that allows decoding into integers of various widths.
///
/// A few observations are important here:
///
/// - In the FLAC format, samples are always signed.
/// - FLAC does not support more than 32 bits per sample.
///   Therefore, converting a sample to `i32` or `i64` can never fail.
///
/// This trait should only be implemented for `i8`, `i16` and `i32`.

    /// The signed integer type that is wide enough to store differences.
    ///
    /// The difference between two values of the sample type might not fit in
    /// a sample type any more, so a wider integer type is required. The wide
    /// type must be able to store at least twice a difference, so it must be
    /// two bits wider than the sample type itself.

///
/// This trait is what is used internally for decoding. It is accessed via
/// `Sample::Wide`. A wider sample than the final result is required for two
/// reasons: channel decorrelation might need an extra bit for the side
/// channel, and prediction might need an extra bit to store the residues. One
/// could use `i64` everywhere and it will be wide enough, but this trait
/// enables using the narrowest integer type that is wide enough, saving memory.
